# Responsive React Notes Blog

Atm, this is a **super** minimalist &amp; responsive blog site that runs entirely in JavaScript on the front-end using `react-router`'s `<HashRouter />`. You can see a modified version of it [here](https://jamesheston.com).

## Current Features
* Posts index nav window with "Search titles" filtering 
* Sass integration with repos build and watch commands
* Responsive from phone to desktop

## Planned Features
* <Post#> files will be stored as Markdown and automatically converted into HTML on the front-end.  
* Multiple Themes
