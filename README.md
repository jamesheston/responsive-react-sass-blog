# Responsive React Notes Blog

Atm, this is a **minimalist** &amp; responsive blog site that runs entirely in JavaScript on the front-end using `react-router`'s `<HashRouter />`. You can see a modified version of it [here](https://jamesheston.com). It was created to be a bare-bones blog for whatever coding notes I wanted easy access to later.

## Current Features
* Posts index nav window with "search titles" filtering 
* Sass integration with `run` (which includes watch) and `build` commands
* Responsive from phone to desktop
* Source code styles


## Planned Features
* <Post#> files in the `src/data/posts` will be stored as Markdown files and automatically converted into HTML on the front-end.  
* Multiple CSS themes with easy switching, for trying out design ideas
